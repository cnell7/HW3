Server side of SMTP is now finished and this is the client side. My program will read a forward-file (having the format of the file you created in Homework 2) and generate and write to standard output the SMTP messages necessary to send the contents of the mail messages in the forward-file to a destination SMTP server. My program 
both generates SMTP server messages and listens for the SMTP response messages that a real server would emit in response to receiving my messages.
